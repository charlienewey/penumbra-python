# Penumbra

This repository contains the code for the testing code used in the paper;
"Shadow detection for mobile robots: features, evaluation, and datasets".

`sweet` is a Python package that is aimed at evaluating texture extraction
algorithms' invariance to shadows - such that experiments can be performed on
texture extraction techniques to discover the most shadow-invariant.

The datasets used in this paper can be found [here][1].
