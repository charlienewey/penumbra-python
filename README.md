# Penumbra

This repository contains the code for the test suites used in my final-year major project; "Shadow
Detection for Mobile Robots".

`sweet` is a Python package that is aimed at evaluating texture extraction algorithms' invariance to
shadows -- such that experiments can be performed on texture extraction techniques to discover the
most shadow-invariant.
